# **ABOUT ME**

---

I am a third year undergraduate student of Computer Science and Engineering from Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering, Mumbai, India. I am comfortable and fluent with programming languages like Python, Java, C and JavaScript.

I started my tryst with Computer Science and Engineering, back in the 7th grade working on VisualBasic as a software tool. Having come a long way with this subject, in the past I have also worked as a _Web Developer_ with my main tool as Django as a framework. I worked as a mentee in DJ Unicode producing a website as a backend developer. In the summer of 2019, I interned at _Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited_ as a web development intern. I also attended a summer school at CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad. It is here that I discovered the niche field of _Vision and Language_ and have been hooked on ever since.

I have been working on a couple of Machine Learning and Computer Vision projects that vary from Image generation to Depth Perception. One of the major reasons for my interest in ML is that it easily correlates to my love for mathematics.

Another one of my passions is my love of writing. Currently I am the Vice Chairperson of Editorial at DJ ACM, a prestigious student chapter of my college. I am also an amateur photographer. Having covered major college events in my sophomore year, I still continue to take pictures from my phone, though the exposure they receive is much less.

Writing I believe, is one of the most expressive form of communicating one's emotion, and often I find myself compelled to write, but the same matter finds no audience. Thus, this blog. I hope to use this as a medium through which I can abridge my love for tech into words that I know best.
